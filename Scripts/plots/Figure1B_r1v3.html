      “Okay, let's try to figure out what cell type this is. The metadata says it's from blood, COVID-19, and a 4-year-old human. The genes listed are in descending expression order.
      <br><br>
      First, I'll look for immune cell markers. Blood cells are typically myeloid or lymphoid. Let's check the genes. High expression of B2M and ACTB are common housekeeping genes, so not specific. Then there's TMSB4X, which is involved in actin regulation, found in various cells.
      <br><br>
      Looking further, RPS and RPL genes are ribosomal proteins, present in most cells, but maybe not helpful here. Then NKG7 stands out—it's associated with cytotoxic cells like NK cells and CD8+ T cells. GNLY (granulysin) and GZMB (granzyme B) are also cytotoxic markers. CCL5 is a chemokine produced by T cells and NK cells..."

      “The cell exhibits high expression of cytotoxic markers (GNLY, GZMB, NKG7, CST7), ribosomal proteins (RPS/RPL genes), and MHC class I genes (HLA-A/B/C), alongside CD7 and CCL5. These features are characteristic of cytotoxic lymphocytes, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, which are activated during viral infections like COVID-19. The absence of T-cell receptor-associated genes (e.g., CD3) further supports an NK cell identity.

      "Based on the metadata and gene expression profile provided, this cell is likely a cytotoxic T cell (CD8+ T cell). Here's the reasoning:
      <br><br>
      1. **Tissue and Disease Context**: The cell is from blood and associated with COVID-19, which is consistent with an immune cell type, particularly T cells, heavily involved in antiviral responses.
      <br><br>
      2. **Key Marker Genes**: NKG7, GNLY, GZMB, GZMA, CCL5, and CST7 are highly specific to cytotoxic T cells and NK cells...
      <br><br>
      5. **Granularity**: The presence of cytotoxic effector molecules (e.g., GZMB, GZMA) and the absence of markers for other T cell subsets (e.g., FOXP3 for regulatory T cells or CD4 for helper T cells) further narrows this down to a cytotoxic CD8+ T cell.
